# Exciton_Delocalization_Funnelling
Codes and data for simulation of Exciton delocalization in confined adjecent quantum wells

The python code GUI_2.0.py runs a GUI application on screen to visualize delocalization of exciton wavefunction in adjacent quantum wells.
The parameters that the user can tune are the number of wells (2,3 or 4), width of each well, barrier height and oscillation dephasing time. The simulation shows the evolution of wavefunction in time, and the plot of population in each well as a function of time. 

Also the videos show as example simulations, wavefunction delocalization for a two-quantum well system.
